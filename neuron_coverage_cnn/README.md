# Coverage VS. # Adv Examples (Figure 6 and figure 7)

---
## General Steps:

1. Before the experiment, please be sure that the data is well prepared according to the tutorial in the main page of the repository.

2. Get the results of coverage metrics change with numbers of adversarial examples (figure 6):

   ```$ python coverage_curve.py ``` 

   All results will be stored in 'coverage_result.txt'. It will also generate several '.npy' files and store them in 'Q2_original' folder for post-process. The excel file we use to generate figure 6 is 'figure 6.xlsx'. It includes the results and the figure 6 we got.

3. Get the change of TKNP with numbers of inputs (blue line in figure 7):

   ```$ python tknp_testing.py ``` 

   The results will be stored in 'testing_coverage_result.txt'. It will also generate a 'tknp_all.npy' file in 'Q2_original' folder  for post-process. To generate figure 7, we need the results from this step and "TKNP VS. # adversarial examples" related data from step 2 ('cov_tknp.npy' in 'Q2_original' folder, the red line in figure 7). The excel file we use to generate figure 7 is 'figure 7.xlsx'. It includes the data we use and the figure 7 we got.
